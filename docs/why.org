* Why

Macros have been receiving much attention for a long time and there
are already numerous resources available for those who want to learn
about them. So why begin writing more about Macros in Guile?

First of all, we have to think about the primary purpose of the Guile
programming language. It is a kind of language for which ubiquity must
be its main power - it has to be widely used, and it has to be
familiar to many people. If one of the advantages of providing
extension language to large applications is that users can easily add
functionality to it, then the extension language should be really
ubiquitous, since otherwise the chance that the scripting language of
an application at hand will be familiar to many users will be
lower. One good thing
